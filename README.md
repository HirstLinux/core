# core (HirstLinux)

Core packages for HirstLinux

The inspiration for this project came from @emmett1's lfs-scripts project which used the Crux Linux package manager to build a LFS system. (https://github.com/emmett1/lfs-scripts)

This project will include a broad selection of packages and will be using the ArchLinux package manager pacman. 

#### Build Requirements

These packages will be built in Jenkins using the toolchain docker container. Please build/pull this container first.

#### Contributing
Contributions are certainly welcome; feel free to submit an issue or PR! I'm very open to design changes as this is mainly an educational project at this point.

#### License

All packages used here are licensed under their various licenses and any modifications or additions made in this project shall be licensed under the GPLv3 license.

#### Notes

This is very much still a work in progress. 

This project will be split into multiple repositories for differing purposes and is intended to become a base which can be easily used for custom distributions and lightweight systems.
